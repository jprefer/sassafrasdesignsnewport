									<h2>F A Q s</h2>

									<button class="accordion">WHERE DO I REGISTER <br>AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</button>
										<div class="panel">
									  <p>Once you have decided to register for your own custom pieces of 
									  Marie Daage tableware and accessories, a custom registry will be 
									  set up within five (5) days of your selections and in just a few 
									  clicks, your guests can make purchases on your behalf.  
									  With one link, share it with ease to your friends and 
									  family with the privacy settings of your choosing.  
									  Sassafras Designs believes that oftentimes, guests prefer to select 
									  gifts after the wedding or purchase additional pieces for the couple’s 
									  first wedding anniversary.  The registry will remain up and running 
									  up to and including your first wedding anniversary. Of course, 
									  Sassafras Designs will always have a record of what you have 
									  chosen and can produce more pieces at any time.  </p>
									</div>

									<button class="accordion">HOW TO ADD TO MY REGISTRY?</button>
									<div class="panel">
 									 <p>Contact Sassafras Designs with any changes or additional 
 									 pieces you may want to add or change from your registry.  </p>
									</div>

									<button class="accordion">HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN <br>SOMEONE PURCHASES A GIFT?</button>
									<div class="panel">
 									 <p>Every time a gift is purchased for you, we will send you an email record of the purchase. 
 									 The email will feature the item or items that have been selected for you and will also include 
 									 a personal message from the gift giver.  Sassafras Designs will also keep a running inventory 
 									 of what has been purchased and what remains to be purchased from your selections for up to 
 									 and including your first wedding anniversary.</p>
									</div>
									<button class="accordion">WHAT IF A GUEST WANTS TO<br> BRING A GIFT TO A PARTY?</button>
										<div class="panel">
									  <p>Pieces are ordered immediately upon purchase through the Registry.  
									  Unfortunately, due to the custom nature of Marie Daage tableware and 
									  accessories, production requires a 12 week lead time.  If there is 
									  sufficient time from the time of ordering, the ordered pieces by a 
									  specific guest can be sent directly to them at their request so 
									  that they can be presented to you in person. </p>
									</div>

									<button class="accordion">HOW CAN GUESTS PURCHASE GIFTS? </button>
									<div class="panel">
 									 <p>Day or night, your guests will be able to shop any time on your 
 									 registry at Sassafrasdesigns.com.</p>
									</div>

									<button class="accordion">WILL I BE ABLE TO HAVE A LIST OF ALL<br>THE GIFTS THAT HAVE <br>PURCHASED FROM MY REGISTRY ?</button>
									<div class="panel">
 									 <p>Absolutely. You will be able to view all the gifts 
 									 that have been purchased alongside the names of the
 									  purchasers.</p>
									</div>
									<button class="accordion">WILL I HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING<br> TO HAVE MY GIFTS DELIVERED TO ME?</button>
									<div class="panel">
 									 <p>Each registry purchase has a shipping fee applied to it, that way
 									  when it is time to receive your gifts, shipping and any related 
 									  customs duty is all taken care of.</p>
									</div>
									<button class="accordion">WHAT IF I WANT TO EXCHANGE ITEMS<br> THAT I HAD REGISTERED FOR ?</button>
									<div class="panel">
 									 <p>Sassafras Designs takes special care to work with prospective brides and grooms to ensure that the 
 									 pieces they select are exactly what they want.  
 									 Therefore, due to the custom nature of Marie Daage tableware 
 									 and accessories, returns and exchanges cannot be accepted.</p>
