									<h3>HOW TO ADD TO MY REGISTRY?</h3>
<p>Contact Sassafras Designs with any changes or additional pieces you may want to add or change from your registry. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE PURCHASES A GIFT FROM MY REGISTRY?</h3>
<p>Every time a gift is purchased for you, we will send you an email record of the purchase. The email will feature the item or items that have been selected for you and will also include a personal message from the gift giver. &nbsp;Sassafras Designs will also keep a running inventory of what has been purchased and what remains to be purchased from your selections for up to and including your first wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WHAT IF A GUEST WANTS TO BRING A GIFT TO A PARTY?</h3>
<p>Pieces are ordered immediately upon purchase through the Registry. &nbsp;Unfortunately, due to the custom nature of Marie Daage tableware and accessories, production requires a 12 week lead time. &nbsp;If there is sufficient time from the time of ordering, the ordered pieces by a specific guest can be sent directly to them at their request so that they can be presented to you in person. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HOW CAN GUESTS PURCHASE GIFTS?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Day or night, your guests will be able to shop any time on your registry at Sassafrasdesigns.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WILL I BE ABLE TO HAVE A LIST OF ALL THE GIFTS THAT HAVE PURCHASED FROM MY REGISTRY ?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. You will be able to view all the gifts that have been purchased alongside the names of the purchasers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WILL I HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING TO HAVE MY GIFTS DELIVERED TO ME?</h3>
<p>Each registry purchase has a shipping fee applied to it, that way when it is time to receive your gifts, shipping and any related customs duty is all taken care of.</p>
<h3>WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND&nbsp;AND WANT TO&nbsp;EXCHANGE ITEMS THAT I HAD REGISTERED&nbsp;FOR ?</h3>
<p>Sassafras Designs takes special care to work with prospective brides and grooms to ensure that the pieces they select are exactly what they want. &nbsp;Therefore, due to the custom nature of Marie Daage tableware and accessories, returns and exchanges cannot be accepted.</p>
