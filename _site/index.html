												<h3>MY STORY</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The question that begins every project is “what is the client hoping to achieve?”  
											“Is it: a space infused with brightness and energy or a peaceful respite from the outside world?”  
											“Or is it just a few tweaks here and there to refresh a well loved home?”  </p>
									<p>Owner and principal designer Maggie Stansfield set out to learn how to develop the 
									answers to those questions when she left a long career in the legal world in Washington DC 
									to return home to Newport and explore her creative side.   Sassafras Designs was born in the summer of 
									2012 after a new beginning at Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island.  
									She has been the owner and principal designer at Sassafras Designs ever since.</p>

												<h3>“It has been a pleasure ....</h3>
												<p>“It has been a pleasure working with the designer. The project was to design and decorate the whole house. Every room was well thought out. The whole house came together as a perfect finished piece. The designer was very cooperative in getting my input, likes and dislikes. The end product turned out to be one beyond my imagination- a absolutely perfect designed and decorated home which we are looking forward to enjoy.
													Thank you for all the hard work, creativity and fun along the way."</p>

												<h3>"Maggie did an....</h3>
												<p>"Maggie did an outstanding job from start to finish! She quickly learned my preferences then magically created a number of options. As someone who admittedly can go into analysis paralysis when faced with too many choices, I greatly appreciate Maggie’s ability to narrow down the scope of options to a manageable size. And I couldn’t be more pleased with how things turned out! My room was transformed from one that was rather blasé to one that is warm, yet chic. The look and feel are precisely what I was looking for. Thank you very much, Maggie!"</p>

												<h3>"Sassafras Designs....</h3>
												<p>"Sassafras Designs has been assisting me with my Jamestown, RI property. They have been instrumental in the garden designs, selection of plants / flowers, discussions and actual planting. What a transformation of the landscape! The ideas put forth are done so with enthusiasm, creativity and clarity of the "why" and "when". What's important to mention is their attention to detail no matter how small it may be and completion of each job on time (as agreed upon by both parties). Sassafras has supplied me with the most beautiful and authentic Pottery Vases for the gardens from France! They went above and beyond by driving them to RI!"</p>
